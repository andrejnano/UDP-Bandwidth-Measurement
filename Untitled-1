IPK 2018, 2nd project - Bandwidth Measurement (Ryšavý)
  
Description
This program is a school project for Computer Communications and Networks 
course at Faculty of Information Technology of Brno University of 
Technology. Main goal of the project is to use a proper communication to
measure the bandwidth between 2 hosts on the Internet. Use of UDP protocol 
is required for measurment.

The project consists of 2 parts. A reflector and a meter.
Both are just runtime modes for the same executable.
Measurement will be done by sending UDP packets from the
meter to the reflector, reflector will then respond.
The meter must implement prober algorithm to measure the max
bandwidth at which there are no lost packets.
